            <p>Maintaining good health is not only about having a good physique and appearance.
     It is about self-satisfaction, inner peace and your behaviour. In today’s competitive era,
      maintaining a healthy mind and body is not so easy; but if you make it a habit from a young age, 
      then you stay fit and healthy throughout your life. We might not understand the value of good health at a very young age,
       but health should be an individual’s first priority. It is only when an individual is healthy they can work dedicatedly along
        with extracurricular activities. It is the most valuable asset than food or money. Greed, dishonesty, and deceitful behaviour 
        are the primary causes of sadness. As a result, it is essential that we inculcate positive ideals in ourselves and teach others 
        to follow the same in order to spread happiness throughout the world. It is essential to maintain a healthy relationship with 
        everyone that keeps you in a positive surrounding. It is necessary to spend some quality time with family and friends. 
        This will not only keep you happy but also give you good energy</p>
